## LLMs Quantization Recipes

Intel® Neural Compressor supported advanced large language models (LLMs) quantization technologies including SmoothQuant (SQ) and Weight-Only Quant (WOQ),
and verified a list of LLMs on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor (codenamed Sapphire Rapids) with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[Intel® Extension for PyTorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) and [Intel® Extension for Transformers](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers).  
This document aims to publish the specific recipes we achieved for the popular LLMs and help users to quickly get an optimized LLM with limited 1% accuracy loss.

> Notes:
>
> - The quantization algorithms provide by [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) and the evaluate functions provide by [Intel® Extension for Transformers](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers).
> - The model list are continuing update, please expect to find more LLMs in the future.
